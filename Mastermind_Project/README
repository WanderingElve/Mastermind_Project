Final Project: Master Mind (Arduino Style)
Collaborations:

Some functions used for the the handshaking procedure
use Assignment 1 code created by Prof. Zachary Friggstad namely:
Wait_on_Serial3, uint32_to_Serial3, and uint32_from_Serial3.
An adapted version of these functions is used in this code.


Accessories:

Arduino Mega 2560 Board

Adafruit ILI934 breakout board

Joystick

Pushbutton




Wiring Instructions:

Adafruit ILI934 breakout board:


Adafruit ILI934 GND<->Arduino Gnd

Adafruit ILI934 Vin<->Arduino 5V

Adafruit ILI934 CLK<->Arduino pin 52

Adafruit ILI934 MISO<->Arduino pin 50

Adafruit ILI934 MOSI<->Arduino pin 51

Adafruit ILI934 CS<-> Arduino  pin 10

Adafruit ILI934 D/C<->Arduino pin 9

Adafruit ILI934 Y+<-> Arduino Analog pin A2

Adafruit ILI934 X+<-> Arduino pin 4

Adafruit ILI934 Y-<-> Arduino pin 5

Adafruit ILI934 X-<-> Arduino Analog pin A3

Adafruit ILI934 CCS<-> Arduino pin 6


Joystick:


GND<->Arduino GND

+5V<->Arduino 5V

VRx<->Arduino Analog pin A1

VRy<->Arduino Analog pin A0

SW<->Arduino pin 2

Pushbutton:


Arduino pin 12 <--> Pushbutton

Pushbutton <--> GND

Server/Client:

NOTE: for two player mode always check that you
      have properly wired the transmission and receiving pins

Arduino0 TX3 <--> Arduino1 RX3
Arduino1 RX3 <--> Arduino0 TX3

If the wired Arduino is the server

Arduino pin 13 <--> Arduino 5V

Else if the wired Arduino is the client

Arduino pin 13 <--> Arduino GND



Instructions:
1. Gather two of the following Arduino Mega 2560 Board, joystick, and pushbutton

2. Wire each Arduino according to the above Wiring Instructions

3. Check wiring especially server/client wiring

4. Connect the Arduinos to your computer(s)
(if you are using one computer use the command <arduino-port-select> to
 configure your USB ports before using make upload)
5. Check to make sure you have downloaded the code into a suitable directory

6. Use the command <make upload> to both Arduinos

7. Read How to Play before playing

How to Play:
Part I: Code Selection
1. To play first press the pushbutton once.
2. Move the joystick up and down to select colour
3. Move the joystick left and right to select circle position
4. When you are satisfied, with your Colour Code press the pushbutton again.

Part II: Code Guessing
1. If both pushbuttons have been pressed twice, then your screen will redraw
   with two 4 x 10 patches of circles.
2. Move the joystick up and down to select colour
3. Move the joystick left and right to select circle position
4. When you are satisfied, with your Colour Code press the pushbutton again
5. Your guessed code will draw itself at the top of your screen
   Pay close attention to the grey circles at the top right of your screen
6. Every red circle means that one of the colours you guessed was the right
   colour in the right position.  Every white circle means you guessed the
	 right colour in the wrong position.  If the circles remain grey, then
	 none of the colours you guessed are in the recieved colour code.

Comments:
- If you enter an invalid code, you should only have to reset one Arduino

- Only codes with unique colour codes are allowed for for codes you can send, no duplicates!

- However when you try to guess the received code your colour code can contain duplicates

- The reason we decided not to include duplicate guessable codes is because such codes are easy to break
  making the game less enjoyable
